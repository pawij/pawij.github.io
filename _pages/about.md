This is my academic website, where you can get an idea of the type of research I do in my job as an [Assistant Professor in Computer Science and AI](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p596509-peter-wijeratne) at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/).

Biography
===

I have a background in physics, engineering and computer science which I use in a medical research setting. My speciality is developing probabilistic models of neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration, usually for applications with neuroimaging data.

I'm strongly committed to fairness and equity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). I've conducted outreach activities in schools and started a first-of-its-kind academic mentoring programme, [A-COMPS](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/collaborate/schools-outreach/comps-mentoring-programme) ("Apply Competitively to STEM"), which pairs academics with school students from low-income and under-represented backgrounds to support their applications to university.

Research
===
Broadly speaking, I research two main topics: first, I develop new probabilistic machine learning models; second, I use these models with medical data of various types to learn new information about neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration.

Here's a visualisation of [one of my models](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/73c362193e3e23188b2a74de7824cc4c-Abstract-Conference.html) being used to reveal pixel-level changes in the brain from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of people with Alzheimer's disease.

Location

I work in the [AI Research Group](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/ai-research-group/) in the [Department of Informatics](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/) at the University of Sussex.
