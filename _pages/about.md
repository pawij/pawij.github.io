This is my academic website, where you can get an idea of the type of research I do in my job as a Lecturer in Computer Science and AI at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/).

Biography
===

I have a (somewhat randomly acquired) background in physics, engineering and computer science which I use in a clinical research setting. My speciality is computational and statistical modelling of neurodegeneration and neurodevelopment.

Research
===
Broadly speaking, I research two main topics: first, I develop new disease progression models; second, I use these models with medical data to learn new information.

Location
===
I work in the [AI Research Group](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/ai-research-group/) in the [Department of Informatics](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/) at the University of Sussex.
