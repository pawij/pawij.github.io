This is my academic website, where you can get an idea of the type of research I do in my job as a Senior Research Fellow at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).

I'm a firm believer in open access research, so you can also find links to my pre-prints, publications and codes.

I support equality in science as part of the UCL Computer Science Athena SWAN Committee. To read more about what this committee does look [here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/about/women-computer-science).

I'm also a member of the UCL Computer Science Ethics Committee, which is actually a lot more interesting than you might think. To read more about what this committee does look [here](https://ethics.grad.ucl.ac.uk/).

Biography
===

I have a background in physics, engineering and computer science which I use in a clinical research setting. My speciality is computational and statistical modelling of disease progression
(called "disease progression modelling"), with a particular focus on [Huntington's disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/huntingtons-disease/).

Research
===
Broadly speaking, I research two main topics. First, I develop new disease progression models. Second, I apply these models to patient data to learn new and clinically useful information. #i make computer programs that help doctors understand which disease a patient has and how it will progress.

In my [current project](https://gtr.ukri.org/person/B1FA07FC-77BF-4A31-8CD0-4CB7205CF990/) funded by the [Medical Research Council](https://mrc.ukri.org/), my principle research question is: can we use disease progression modelling to improve clinical trial design?

Location
===
I work between the [UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing/) and the [UCL Huntington's Disease Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/research/centres/hd-centre), within the [UCL Department of Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/) and [UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/), respectively.
