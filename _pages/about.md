This is my academic website, where you can get an idea of the type of research I do in my job as a [Lecturer / Assistant Professor in Computer Science and AI](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p596509-peter-wijeratne) at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/).

Biography
===

I have a (somewhat randomly acquired) background in physics, engineering and computer science which I use in a clinical research setting. My speciality is machine learning and statistical modelling of neurodevelopment and degeneration.

Research
===
Broadly speaking, I research two main topics: first, I develop new latent variable models of progression trajectories; second, I use these models with medical data of various types to learn new information.

Location
===
I work in the [AI Research Group](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/ai-research-group/) in the [Department of Informatics](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/) at the University of Sussex.
