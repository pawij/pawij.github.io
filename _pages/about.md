This is my academic website, where you can get an idea of the type of research I do in my job as a Senior Research Fellow at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).

I'm a firm believer in open-access research, so you can also find links to my pre-prints, publications and codes.

I also support equality in science as part of the UCL Computer Science Athena SWAN Committee. To read more about what the committee does to promote gender equality in computer science look [here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/about/women-computer-science).

Biography
===

I have a background in physics, engineering and computer science which I use in a clinical research setting. My speciality is computational and statistical modelling of disease progression
(called "disease progression modelling"), with a particular focus on [Huntington's disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/huntingtons-disease/).

Research
===
Broadly speaking, I research two main topics. First, I develop new methodologies to model disease progression. Second, I apply these models to real-world patient data to learn new and clinically-useful information.

In my [current project](https://gtr.ukri.org/person/B1FA07FC-77BF-4A31-8CD0-4CB7205CF990/) funded by the [Medical Research Council](https://mrc.ukri.org/), my principle research question is: can we use disease progression modelling to learn patient-specific information and hence improve clinical trial design?

Location
===
I work between the [UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing/) and the [UCL Huntington's Disease Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/research/centres/hd-centre), which are based at the [UCL Department of Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/) and [UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/), respectively.
