This is my academic website, where you can get an idea of the type of research I do in my job as an [Assistant Professor in Computer Science and AI](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p596509-peter-wijeratne) at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/).

Biography
===

I have a (somewhat randomly acquired) background in physics, engineering and computer science which I use in a clinical research setting. My speciality is machine learning and statistical modelling of neurodevelopment and degeneration.

I'm strongly committed to fairness and equity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). I've conducted outreach activities in schools and started a first-of-its-kind academic mentoring programme, [A-COMPS](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/collaborate/schools-outreach/comps-mentoring-programme) ("Apply Competitively to STEM"), which pairs academics with school students from low-income and under-represented backgrounds to support their applications to university.

Research
===
Broadly speaking, I research two main topics: first, I develop new machine learning models of disease progression; second, I use these models with medical data of various types to learn new information about neurodevelopment and degeneration.

Location
===
I work in the [AI Research Group](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/ai-research-group/) in the [Department of Informatics](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/) at the University of Sussex.
